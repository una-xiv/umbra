/// Marks a <b>static</b> method as an initializer for the framework.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The method is called synchronously when the framework is being initialized.
/// A framework initializer is typically used to find and register certain
/// types based on the assemblies in <see cref="Framework.Assemblies"/>.
/// <br/><br/>
/// The method is invoked and executed on the Game thread, meaning it is
/// generally safe to access and interact with game memory. These methods are
/// invoked <i>after</i> all asynchronous initializers have completed.
